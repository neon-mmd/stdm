* STDM (search the damn manual)

Linux man page search engine written in c++ 

* Quick Start

*STDM* is a command line tool to search linux manual pages offline on the system and provides you with relevent information you need. It provides search results by providing excerpt from the manual instead of scrolling through the whole manual for relevent piece of information from the manual it provides you in a nice table format what you need increasing productivity and speed.

** Display Options

	-f	display the full manual with example manual if available
	-s	search the manual page with the functionality
	-e	give the example manual if available
	-l	the number of lines of excerpt to display from the manual (default: 5)
	-L	provide an appropriate launcher (default: fzf)
	-S	search the manual by providing a search term should be used with option '-s' (default: None)

** Examples

*** search the manual name on the basis of functionality and read about it's functionality from the manual

#+begin_src shell
  stdm -s symlink
#+end_src

* Installation

** Arch Linux

The package is available in the [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/stdm-git][aur]] and in neon-os (arch distro) repo

#+begin_src shell
  paru -S stdm-git
#+end_src

Or

add the following lines in the pacman.conf.

#+begin_src text
  [neon-os-core-repo]
  SigLevel = Required DatabaseOptional
  Server = https://gitlab.com/NEON-MMD/$repo/-/raw/main/$arch
#+end_src

*Important:* add the key server, recieve the keys and sign the keys locally. 

#+begin_src shell
  grep -qxF "keyserver.ubuntu.com:80" /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf || echo "keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80" | sudo tee -a /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf
  grep -qxF "keyserver.ubuntu.com:443" /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf || echo "keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443" | sudo tee -a /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/gpg.conf
  sudo pacman-key --recv-key 51F9A14D1DEE561A
  sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 51F9A14D1DEE561A
#+end_src

before installing stdm from pacman. make sure you have *tabulate* c++ module dependency installed through the aur.

#+begin_src shell
  paru -S tabulate
#+end_src

Sync the repository before installing it and also during the sync process it will complain about missing Keys. It is normal and accept the prompt to import it and you are good to go :). 

#+begin_src shell
  sudo pacman -Syyu
#+end_src

then install it using pacman

#+begin_src shell
  sudo pacman -S stdm-git
#+end_src
