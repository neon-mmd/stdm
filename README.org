* STDM (search the damn manual)

Linux  man page search engine written in c++ 

* Quick Start

*STDM* is a command line tool to search linux manual pages offline on the system and provides you with relevent information you need. It provides search results by providing excerpt from the manual instead of scrolling through the whole manual for relevent piece of information from the manual it provides you in a nice table format what you need increasing productivity and speed.

** Display Options

	-f	display the full manual with example manual if available
	-s	search the manual page with the functionality
	-e	give the example manual if available
	-l	the number of lines of excerpt to display from the manual (default: 5)
	-L	provide an appropriate launcher (default: fzf)
	-S	search the manual by providing a search term should be used with option '-s' (default: None)
